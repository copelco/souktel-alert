       the answer should be a special keyword that 
       the application developer defines. The

       function tied to this keyword with the tree 
       app and the tree app will call that function to
       see if the answer should match. The function
       should return any value that maps to True if 
       the answer is valid, otherwise any value that
       maps to False.
